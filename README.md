# Risk Register
These are the current Risks on the project, re-aligned on a weekly basis


# Tenants of Design
The code framework to be used will be Java, we will be programming using the app IntelliJ

# Security:
- SpotBugs: uses static analysis to find bugs in java code. 
 
- PMD: Static code anaylsis checking tool. The tool scans Java source files to look for potential vulnerabilities such as coding errors and security flaws. It offers a cheap alternative to the tedious process of continually going over a huge code base. PMD is also capable of detecting other issues, such as dead code and performance issues along with poor code practices and styling. PMD has been installed through GitHub actions to scan code as it is commited.

# Testing:
    Unit testing
    integration testing
    UA
    API Testing
# Environments:
    staging and production
    tight configuration management for consistency and reproducibility
    automated creation and deployments
    integrated and automated pipeline (commit -> test -> deploy)
# Github version control:
    branches used
    version/release management

# Agile project management methods/principles (jira)
